Traveling_Saleman_GA
--------------------------------------------

Using genetic algorithm to find the minimum costs of travel from start to end with no return.
You can change the route with new fitness function and new list of distances.

----------------------------------------
initial value
----------------
- the number of cities is 4.
- list of distances = matrix 4*4 , (while adjacent = 0)
- population = 10 
- number of gene = 4 
- generation = 20

-----------------------------------------
Process
----------------

- crossover = PMX 
- mutation = swap mutation ( with only one chromosome in each generation. )
